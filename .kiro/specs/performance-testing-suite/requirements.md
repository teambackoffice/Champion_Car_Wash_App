# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive performance validation suite specifically designed for the Champion Car Wash Flutter app. The suite will provide structured testing methodologies, automated validation tools, and continuous monitoring capabilities to ensure the app maintains optimal performance after implementing the memory leak fixes, JSON parsing optimizations, and UI performance improvements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive performance testing checklist specific to Champion Car Wash app workflows, so that I can systematically validate all performance optimizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the testing suite is implemented THEN it SHALL include startup time validation targeting < 2 seconds with 35+ StatefulWidgets
2. WHEN testing booking list performance THEN the system SHALL validate 60fps scrolling with 100+ booking items
3. WHEN testing payment processing THEN the system SHALL ensure UI responsiveness during Stripe NFC operations
4. WHEN testing memory stability THEN the system SHALL validate no memory leaks during technician workflows over 30+ minutes
5. WHEN testing API efficiency THEN the system SHALL validate response handling with the new caching implementation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want before and after metrics tables with specific baselines, so that I can measure the exact impact of performance optimizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN baseline measurements are established THEN the system SHALL record current performance metrics for startup time, frame skips, memory usage, and API response times
2. WHEN post-optimization targets are set THEN the system SHALL define specific improvement goals (e.g., 70% faster startup, 94% reduction in frame skips)
3. WHEN metrics are compared THEN the system SHALL provide clear improvement percentages for each Champion Car Wash workflow
4. WHEN testing is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a performance score from 1-10 based on achieved metrics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want custom lint rules in analysis_options.yaml, so that I can automatically detect performance anti-patterns during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code analysis runs THEN the system SHALL detect StatefulWidget classes without dispose() methods
2. WHEN modal files are analyzed THEN the system SHALL warn about developer.log() calls that slow JSON parsing
3. WHEN TextEditingController usage is detected THEN the system SHALL flag controllers without proper disposal
4. WHEN performance-critical code is written THEN the system SHALL enforce const constructors and efficient widget patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated testing scripts for performance regression detection, so that I can prevent performance degradation in CI/CD pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance regression tests run THEN the system SHALL validate app startup time remains under 2 seconds
2. WHEN memory leak detection executes THEN the system SHALL identify any new memory leaks in StatefulWidgets
3. WHEN API response monitoring runs THEN the system SHALL ensure response times stay within acceptable limits
4. WHEN integration tests execute THEN the system SHALL validate smooth 60fps performance across all Champion Car Wash workflows

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile app developer, I want device-specific testing protocols, so that I can ensure performance across different hardware configurations used by Champion Car Wash technicians.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing on low-end devices THEN the system SHALL validate startup time < 3 seconds on MediaTek processors
2. WHEN testing memory usage THEN the system SHALL ensure < 100MB usage on 2GB RAM devices
3. WHEN testing on high-end devices THEN the system SHALL achieve < 1 second startup and consistent 60fps
4. WHEN testing battery impact THEN the system SHALL measure and validate minimal battery drain during extended usage

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want performance monitoring dashboards and alerts, so that I can track app performance health in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL provide a real-time dashboard showing startup time, memory usage, and frame rates
2. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL trigger red flag alerts for immediate action
3. WHEN performance degrades moderately THEN the system SHALL show yellow flag warnings for monitoring
4. WHEN performance goals are met THEN the system SHALL display green flag indicators confirming optimal performance
5. WHEN continuous monitoring runs THEN the system SHALL track performance trends over time for the Champion Car Wash app
